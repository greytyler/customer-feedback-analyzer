Dataset
The dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.com. I created a free Kaggle account and selected a customer reviews dataset that includes a column with customer-written feedback. You can use any dataset with a review_text or Review Text column.

Features
* 100% terminal, modular and code-based workflow
* Modular: swap out datasets or extend functionality
* Just clean, readable Python

Why I Built This
I'm learning more about AWS by building real-world projects â€” not just watching videos or reading docs. This is one of the first projects in my "Cloud Build Chronicles" series, where I document my growth, share code, and help demystify tech for other career changers.

Next Steps
* Automate deployments with Terraform or CDK
* Include this project in a larger sentiment analytics dashboard
